CONCLUSION </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We investigate random key graph with unreliable links which amounts to the intersection of random key graphs with Erdős-Rényi graphs. We derive zero-one laws for kconnectivity and minimum node degree being at lest k. These zero-one laws are shown to improve the existing results on 1-connectivity of random key graphs with unreliable links as well as k-connectivity of random key graphs.\nAn extension of our work would be to consider a different unreliability model than the independent on/off model used here. One possible candidate is the so-called disk model [29] where two nodes have to be within a certain distance to each other to have a link in between; this induces a random geometric graph. Intersection of random key graphs with random geometric graphs has already received some interest [22], [25], but the model is proven to be difficult to analyze with results obtained thus far for its connectivity [23], [24], [43], not for k-connectivity.\nit is clear that the number of possible instances for realizing the event F is given by\nn -2 m 1 • n -m 1 -2 m 2 • n -m 1 -m 2 -2 m 3 .(206)\nThe event J defined below is an instance of F .
