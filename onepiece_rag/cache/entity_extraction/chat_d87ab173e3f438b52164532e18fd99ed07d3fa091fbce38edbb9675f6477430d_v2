The item characteristics are stored in the ItET. To conserve memory space, the ItET can be accessed by both the filtering and the ranking stage.\nFor the UIETs, ET lookups and pooling operations are done in the filtering and ranking stage, respectively. For the ItET, two primary operations are required: (i) lookups and pooling on the ET to transform a sparse input feature into a dense vector; (ii) the NNS on the ET to return the candidate item IDs in the filtering stage. The iMARS architecture implements the two types of ETs inside its IMC fabric. CMAs integrate reads, searches, and in-memory logic/arithmetic operations in a single array, which makes them a suitable choice for implementing UIETs and ItETs.\nWhile the circuits inside a CMA are described in [9], we introduce the design of a novel, two-level hierarchy based on CMAs and adder trees to store and efficiently compute on the large number of items in the ETs as needed by the RecSys. The components that implement ETs inside iMARS (i.e., the CMAs and adder trees) are discussed below.\nHierarchical CMAs: To accomodate the large ETs, B banks of CMAs are deployed in iMARS. Fig. 3(b) depicts the structure of one CMA bank, which consists of M mats (labeled as Mat-1, Mat-2, ..., Mat-M ). Each mat is comprised of C CMAs that work independently as the IMC engines in iMARS for performing lookups, searches and additions. An individual CMA is depicted in Fig. 3(c). It employs CAM sense amplifiers (SAs) based on a preset threshold, as well as searchline (SL) drivers and priority encoders to perform threshold based NNS. We chose to implement threshold based matching in the CAM based on a reference current generated by a dummy 1T+1FeFET cell, which can be adjusted to compensate for process variations or to change the sensitivity of the Hamming distance in the NNS operation. The RAM SAs, wordline (WL) and bitline (BL) drivers are used during lookups. Pooling operations are performed with in-memory additions (through an accumulator placed next to the RAM SA). More details on the CMA structure can be found in [9]. FeFET-based CMAs [9] are utilized to implement the ETs. When compared to CMOS-based counterparts, FeFET-based CMAs have higher density (which helps to reduce the area footprint) and lower leakage power [8].\nAdder trees: To support the accumulation of a large number of parameters, we develop a hierarchical, adder tree structure. Specifically, iMARS uses in-memory addition to sum, in a single memory array, embeddings comprised of 32 dimensions with int-8 quantization. To accumulate (sum up) the outputs of the CMAs for each mat, iMARS sums up C 256-bit (i.e., 32×8)-bit numbers leveraging a near-memory, 256-bit intramat adder tree placed in each mat. Different mats can perform intra-mat additions in parallel. Once the intra-mat additions are completed, their results are accumulated across the K mats to produce a single 256-bit result (one output per memory bank). iMARS supports the addition of four 256-bit inputs inside a near-memory \"Intra-bank Adder Tree\" in one shot (bottom right of Fig. 3(b)). In other words, we design an \"Intra-bank Adder Tree\" with a fan-in of 4, a design choice made as a compromise between area footprint of the iMARS banks and performance of the intra-bank addition. In cases where more inputs need to be accumulated (i.e., when K > 4), multiple rounds of addition are needed using the same \"Intra-bank Adder Tree\".\nThe aforementioned design parameters B, M and C largely impact the area, capacity and the performance of iMARS. First, area footprint increases proportionally to B, M and C. Larger B, M and C increase the capacity of iMARS for storing embeddings. High capacity enables iMARS to accomodate big workloads. However, a large C implies a large fan-in for the \"Intra-mat Adder Tree\" inside each mat, which leads to parasitic effects that increases the delay for aggregating the outputs of multiple CMAs. A large K, in turn, implies that more mats are connected to (and sharing) the same communication bus, which increases the overall latency of the RecSys (to be discussed in Sec. III-A3).\n2) DNN Stack: The DNN stack requires matrix-vector multiplications which can be implemented using crossbar arrays in iMARS (Fig. 3(a)). Two dedicated crossbar banks are employed to execute the ranking and the filtering DNN stack composed of fully connected layers. Each crossbar bank contains multiple crossbar arrays (Fig. 3(d)) in order to accomodate the respective DNN model. These crossbar banks both hold the DNN Stack to obtain dense features and the DNN stack that returns a user embedding during the filtering stage or a user item-score for the ranking stage. Crossbar arrays can leverage the FeFET technology [18].\n3) Communication inside iMARS: Data among the different hardware components of iMARS need to be communicated. To ensure such communication does not incur too much overhead, we carefully design communication channels inside iMARS. There are two types of communication in iMARS: (1) communication among the different functional blocks and (2) communication between the mats in each CMA bank. While (1) leverages the Rec\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
