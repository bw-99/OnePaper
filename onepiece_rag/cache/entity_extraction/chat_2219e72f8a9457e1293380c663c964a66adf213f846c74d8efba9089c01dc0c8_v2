We then sampled users that follow these content producer accounts. All users are anonymized with no other personally identifiable information (e.g., demographic features) present. Additionally, the timestamp of each follow edge was mapped to an integer that respects date ordering, but does not provide any information about the date that follow occurred.

This metric is given by considering a fixed number of top candidates yield by a retrieval system (up to size K) and measuring what percent of these candidates are heldout relevant candidates. The purpose of most candidate retrieval systems is to collect a high-recall pool of items for further ranking, and thus recall is a relevant metric to consider. Additionally, recall provides an indirect way to measure diversity -to achieve high recall, one is obliged to return a large fraction of all relevant documents, which simple greedy ANN searches can struggle with. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Diversity: </p><h2>text</h2> <p>To evaluate the diversity among the retrieved candidates, we measure the spread in the embeddings of the retrieved candidates by calculating the average distance retrieved candidates are from their centroid. The underlying idea is that when 'locality implies similarity'; as a corollary, if candidates are further in Euclidean distance, then they are likely to be different. As such, for a given set of candidates C, we compute diversity D as follows:\nD(C) = 1 |C| i k ∈C ∥i k -î∥(8)\nwhere C denotes the set of retrieved candidates and î = i k ∈C i k /|C| is the mean of the unimodal embeddings of the retrieved candidates. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Goodness of Fit: </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In addition to diversity of retrieved items, we need to ensure that a user's mixture representation is an accurate model of their intereststhat is the mixture of embeddings identifies points in the embedding space where relevant items lie.
