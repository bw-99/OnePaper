The maps define the relationship between the hyperbolic space and the corresponding tangent space. Given a point x ∈ M and a vector v ∈ T x M, a unique geodesic 𝛾 : [0, 1] → M exists, satisfying 𝛾 (0) = x, 𝛾 ′ (0) = v. The exponential map, symbolized as exp x : T x M → M, is defined such that exp x (v) = 𝛾 (1). Conversely, the logarithmic map, denoted as log x , acts as the inverse of exp x . Furthermore, the parallel transport 𝑃𝑇 x→y : T xM → T yM achieves the transportation from point x to point y, while ensuring the preservation of the metric tensors.\nHyperbolic Models. Hyperbolic geometry describes a curved space with negative curvature. There are several mathematically equivalent ways to model hyperbolic geometry that emphasize different properties, but our methods apply to hyperbolic geometry in general and are not limited to any particular model.
