Additionally, PEP mainly emphasizes on the model size, i.e., it stops searching once the embedding table reaches a predefined parameter size. This approach may result in a suboptimal embedding table due to overlooking the model performance. AutoFieldfoot_1 also employs the top 𝐾 selection manner, again leading to feature misselection and inferior model performance. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b14', 'b32', 'b15', 'b7', 'b12'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_2'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Transferability Analysis (RQ2) </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In this subsection, we explore the transferability of iHAS.

We can observe that: (i) all the recommendation models have great improvement by adopting iHAS, which again demonstrates the importance of performing selection in the recommendations; (ii) The transferability of iHAS is better than the best baseline (by comparing the iHAS and AdaFS-soft in Table 3), which validates the effectiveness of our Bernoulli gates.\nIn summary, we conclude that iHAS has outstanding transferability across different recommendation models, which enables it to be leveraged in complicated real-world recommender systems. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b25', 'b3', 'b7'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_4', 'tab_4'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Ablation Study (RQ3) </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In this subsection, we conduct the ablation study of key components in iHAS, as shown in Table 4.

After we have the welltrained Bernoulli gates, we select dimensions across all samples to retrain one recommender model instead of separating samples into different clusters for retraining cluster-customized recommender models; (iii) iHAS-3: This variant is the standard iHAS without using the polarization regularizer described in Section 3. initialized vector of the dimension length, making every sample share the same probability for every dimension.\nBased on the results in Table 4, we can find: (i) iHAS and its variants can increase the AUC and decrease the Logloss compared with the Base model, which indicates the necessity of performing selection on embedding dimensions for boosting model performance; (ii) iHAS performs better than iHAS-1, which indicates the necessity of the subsequent clustering and retraining stages; (iii) iHAS-1 outperforms iHAS-2, therefore, separating instances into different groups, i.e., the clustering stage, is beneficial for boosting the performance; (iv) Polarization is vital for acquiring better Bernoulli gates by comparing iHAS with iHAS-3; (v) Respecting the difference between instances can further boost the performance by comparing iHAS with iHAS-4. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_5', 'tab_5'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Efficiency Analysis (RQ4) </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In addition to model performance, efficiency is vital when deploying the recommendation model into online systems, especially inference efficiency.

This is because iHAS feed different test data into its preferred recommender model of smaller size instead of feeding all test data into a single model which may lead to additional inference cost on some data.
