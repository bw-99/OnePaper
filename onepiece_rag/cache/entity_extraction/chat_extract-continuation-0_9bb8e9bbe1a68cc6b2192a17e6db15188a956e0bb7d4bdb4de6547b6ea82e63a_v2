For any point x on M, we define a tangent space T x M, acting as the first-order approximation of M in the vicinity of x. This tangent space is an 𝑛-dimensional vector space that is isomorphic to R 𝑛 . The metric 𝑔 on the Riemannian \n𝐿(𝛾) = ∫ 𝛽 𝛼 ∥𝛾 ′ (𝑡)∥ 𝑔 𝑑𝑡. Then the distance of u, v ∈ M, 𝑑 M (u, v) = inf 𝐿(𝛾) where 𝛾 is a curve that 𝛾 (𝑎) = u, 𝛾 (𝑏) = v.\nMaps and Parallel Transport. The maps define the relationship between the hyperbolic space and the corresponding tangent space. Given a point x ∈ M and a vector v ∈ T x M, a unique geodesic 𝛾 : [0, 1] → M exists, satisfying 𝛾 (0) = x, 𝛾 ′ (0) = v. The exponential map, symbolized as exp x : T x M → M, is defined such that exp x (v) = 𝛾 (1). Conversely, the logarithmic map, denoted as log x , acts as the inverse of exp x . Furthermore, the parallel transport 𝑃𝑇 x→y : T xM → T yM achieves the transportation from point x to point y, while ensuring the preservation of the metric tensors.\nHyperbolic Models. Hyperbolic geometry describes a curved space with negative curvature. There are several mathematically equivalent ways to model hyperbolic geometry that emphasize different properties, but our methods apply to hyperbolic geometry in general and are not limited to any particular model. Formulas for concepts such as distance, maps, and parallel transport are summarized in Appendix B. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Graph Curvature </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Curvature is a fundamental concept in smooth spaces that has also generalized to discrete objects (e.g., graphs). There are several distinct notions of discrete Ricci curvature for graphs or networks, such as the Forman-Ricci curvature [21] and Ollivier-Ricci curvature [58]. Here we mainly focus on ORC since it is more geometrical [33,58]. Another reason is ORC builds a bridge between continuous geometry and discrete structures [2,76].
