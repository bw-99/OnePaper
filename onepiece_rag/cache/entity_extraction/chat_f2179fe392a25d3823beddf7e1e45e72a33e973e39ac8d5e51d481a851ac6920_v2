This table presents the effectiveness of sc-OTGM in identifying known differentially expressed genes (DEGs) following targeted gene knockdowns. Statistical validation is provided through p-Values obtained from Fisher's exact test, confirming a significant correlation between predicted and known DEGs for all targeted gene knockdown experiments, well below the significance threshold of 0.05. The columns labeled 'Accuracy (%)' and 'F1-score' evaluate sc-OTGM's performance to accurately predict the direction of expression changes-either upregulation or downregulation-in DEGs. The mean accuracy of 75.2% ± 15.4% and mean F1-score of 0.79 ± 0.14 show the model's performance in predicting gene expression dynamics. </p><h2>figure_data</h2> <p>GeneDEG Enrichment Perturbation Response Predictionp-ValueAcc.
