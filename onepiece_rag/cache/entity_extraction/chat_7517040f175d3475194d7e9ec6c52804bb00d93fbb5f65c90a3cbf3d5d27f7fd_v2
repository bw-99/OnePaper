A solid line with an arrow pointing from i to j is associated with the event that t e (i, j) takes value 1. A dotted line with an arrow pointing from i to j indicates a missing value of t e (i, j) and that there exists an implicit trust of i on j, which can be inferred from T e . The lightning symbol in the 4th sub-figure indicates a cut-off of the trust information flow.\nfor every user, how much she could trust every other user. In this way, it outputs an estimated trust matrix T , the (i, j)th cell t(i, j) (if present) of which represents how much the ith user trusts the jth user. The input matrix T e has a very limited number of cells that take value 1 and all the other cells are empty with missing values. If the (i, j)th cell of T e , denoted by t e (i, j), takes value 1, it means that user i has expressed a trust statement that she trusts user j. It is worth noting that, in practical applications, the available trust data, represented as matrix T e here, would always be very sparse. This is so because no user can reasonably interact with every other user and then issue a trust statement about them. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Four categories of trust information flow patterns </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We categorize the patterns of the trust information flow from user u to v into 4 complementary classes. For each class, we show a typical example in Fig. 2. The 1st sub-figure corresponds to the case in which t e (u, v) = 1. If t e (i, j) = 1, then j is called an explicit trustee of i. The 2nd sub-figure exemplifies the case in which v is not an explicit trustee of u but u and v have common explicit trustee(s). The 3rd sub-figure exemplifies the case in which v is not an explicit trustee of u, u and v have no common explicit trustee but there is at least one trust propagation path from u to v. A trust propagation path from i to j is defined by a series of user pairs p m , p m+1 , m = 1, . . . , M -1, M ∈ N, which satisfies p 1 = i, p M = j, and t(p m , p m+1 ) > 0, ∀m ∈ 1, . . . , M -1. This model indicates that, if user i trusts another user k to some extent and user k trusts user j to some extent, then there will be a trust propagation path from i to j. Note that this model conforms to the transitivity property of the concept of trust [9,15,16]. The 4th sub-figure is associated with the case that there is no trust propagation path from u to v. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b8', 'b14', 'b15'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Trust inference procedures </p><h2>text</h2> <p>First we initialize T to be a zero matrix. Given a pair of users, u and v, we first determine which one of the 4 categories presented above the pattern of the trust information flow from u to v belongs to. If it belongs to the 1st category, set t(u, v) = 1. If it belongs to the 2nd category, we estimate t(u, v) as follows\nt(u, v) = |S(u) S(v)| |S(u) S(v)| ,(6)\nwhere S(i) denotes the set of i's explicit trustees. For the case shown in the 2nd sub-figure of Fig. 2, we then have t(u, v) = 2/3. Now we focus on the case in which the pattern of the trust information flow from u to v belongs to the 3rd category. We consider every user pair i, j that belongs to any one of the aforementioned two categories and estimate t(i, j) correspondingly. Then we exploit trust propagation over the trust network defined by T to estimate t for user pairs associated with the 3rd category. We treat the trust matrix T as a weighted directed graph G, in which the nodes denote the users and the weight of an edge denotes the trust of the starting vertex on the end vertex. For a pair of users, say u and v, there may be multiple paths originating from u and ending at v, as exemplified in the 3rd sub-figure of Fig. 2. To compute t(u, v), we first build up a reciprocal trust matrix Tr , whose (i, j)th cell tr (i, j) = 1/ t(i, j) if t(i, j) > 0; otherwise, set tr (i, j) = ∞. We treat the reciprocal trust matrix as a weighted directed graph G r .
