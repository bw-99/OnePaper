This multi-embedding scheme represents a source entity with multiple distinct topical affinities by globally clustering items and aggregating the source entity's engagements with clusters. Recognizing that user-item engagements may often be sparse, we propose a nearest-neighbor smoothing to enrich these mixture representation. Our smoothed mixture representation better models user preferences retrieving a diverse set of candidate items reflective of a user's multiple interests. This significantly improves recall on candidate retrieval tasks on three datasets including Twitter-Follow, a dataset we curate and release to the community. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p>\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>KNN-EMBED<|>concept<|>kNN-Embed is a method designed to transform single user dense embeddings into mixtures of embeddings, aiming to better model user interests and enhance retrieval recall and diversity.)\n(\"entity\"<|>USER INTERESTS<|>concept<|>User interests refer to the preferences and inclinations of users, which can be modeled through various embedding techniques to improve item retrieval.)\n(\"entity\"<|>RETRIEVAL RECALL<|>concept<|>Retrieval recall is a measure of the ability of a system to retrieve relevant items from a dataset, which kNN-Embed aims to improve.)\n(\"entity\"<|>DIVERSITY<|>concept<|>Diversity in this context refers to the variety of items retrieved for a user, reflecting their multiple interests and preferences.)\n(\"entity\"<|>USER-ITEM ENGAGEMENTS<|>concept<|>User-item engagements are interactions between users and items, which can be sparse and are crucial for modeling user preferences.)\n(\"entity\"<|>NEAREST-NEIGHBOR SMOOTHING<|>concept<|>Nearest-neighbor smoothing is a technique proposed to enrich mixture representations of user-item engagements, enhancing the modeling of user preferences.)\n(\"entity\"<|>TWITTER-FOLLOW DATASET<|>concept<|>The Twitter-Follow dataset is a curated dataset released to the community, used for evaluating the performance of the kNN-Embed method.)\n(\"relationship\"<|>KNN-EMBED<|>USER INTERESTS<|>kNN-Embed is designed to better model user interests through the transformation of embeddings<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>KNN-EMBED<|>RETRIEVAL RECALL<|>kNN-Embed aims to improve retrieval recall by providing a more accurate representation of user interests<|>9)\n(\"relationship\"<|>KNN-EMBED<|>DIVERSITY<|>kNN-Embed enhances diversity in item retrieval by reflecting multiple user interests<|>8)\n(\"relationship\"<|>USER-ITEM ENGAGEMENTS<|>KNN-EMBED<|>User-item engagements are a key input for the kNN-Embed method, influencing its effectiveness<|>7)\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEAREST-NEIGHBOR SMOOTHING<|>KNN-EMBED<|>Nearest-neighbor smoothing is a technique used within kNN-Embed to improve the representation of user preferences<|>6)\n(\"relationship\"<|>TWITTER-FOLLOW DATASET<|>KNN-EMBED<|>The Twitter-Follow dataset is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the kNN-Embed method<|>7) \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
