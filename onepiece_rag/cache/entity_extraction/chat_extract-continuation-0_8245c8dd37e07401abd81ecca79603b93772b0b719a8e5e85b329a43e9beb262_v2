Crossbars can efficiently implement matrix-vector multiplications, and are thus ideal accelerators for DNN models such as convolutional neural networks [14].\nGPCiMs [7], [15] perform general-purpose Boolean logic and arithmetic operations inside RAM. GPCiMs can employ specialized memory cells based on emerging technologies to perform current-based operations inside a memory array (e.g., [7]). Alternatively, customized memory peripherals (such as sense amplifiers) can be designed to operate with two memory words that are simultaneously selected by row decoders. In GPCiMs that employ customized sensed amplifiers, the voltage (or current flow) through a column-connected bitline is sensed and compared to one (or multiple) reference(s) so the results of Boolean logic/arithmetic can be produced.\nCMAs [8], [9], [15] combine multiple IMC functionalities in the same physical structure. For instance, CMAs can work as either TCAM or GPCiM units at distinct times. Note that conventional TCAMs perform row-wise sensing as matchlines are placed along the row direction. GPCiMs, on the other hand, require the voltage drop (or current flow) through the vertically-connected bitlines to be sensed and compared to one (or more) reference(s) in order to produce the results needed for general-purpose computation. Due to this difference in the TCAM and GPCiM arrays, combining them in a single hardware structure requires additional memory peripherals to achieve re-configurability [8], [9].\nStoring RecSys ETs requires significant amount of memory and substantial communication between memory and processing units, which could be alleviated by IMC architectures. The use of CMAs based on emerging technologies can be beneficial for implementing IMC-based RecSys compared to standard CMOS CMAs [15] due to the increased density of memory cells and lower standby power (a result of the device's non-volatility).\nFeFETs have been used in various IMC based circuits such as CAMs, GPCiMs and CMAs [16], [17]. Previous work has demonstrated the benefits of FeFET-based CMAs over other emerging technologies such as ReRAMs [8], [9]. FeFETs have similar structure as metal-oxide-semiconductor fieldeffect transistors (MOSFETs) used in standard CMOS silicon, except a layer of FE oxide is deposited in the transistor's gate stack. Because of this, FeFETs are compatible with the CMOS fabrication process [10] and large-scale FeFET memories have been demonstrated [10]. For these reasons, we employ a FeFET-based CMA design for accelerating RecSys. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b4', 'b13', 'b6', 'b14', 'b6', 'b7', 'b8', 'b14', 'b7', 'b8', 'b14', 'b15', 'b16', 'b7', 'b8', 'b9', 'b9'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>III. IMC ACCELERATOR FOR RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We propose iMARS, an architecture for RecSys that uses an IMC fabric to accelerate the DNN stack and ET related operations in both the filtering and ranking stage of RecSys. The RecSys ranking and filtering stages use sparse and dense features in determining which items to recommend to the user. The dense features are sent to the DNN stack while the sparse features are sent to ETs. For the DNN stack, crossbars can be readily leveraged. For ET related operations, we leverage CMAs and adder trees placed in the memory periphery. Since different ETs play different roles depending on the stage, how to organize these tables inside the IMC fabric must be considered carefully. We elaborate our proposed architecture in Sec. III-A and computation mapping in Sec. III-C. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>A. iMARS Architecture </p><h2>text</h2> <p>The iMARS architecture, shown in Fig. 3(a), consists of two types of IMC arrays: Crossbar arrays for the DNN stack (bottom) and CMA arrays for the ETs (top). The implementation of the DNN and the ETs inside iMARS is described below.\n1) Embedding Tables: Some sparse features are used in both the ranking and filtering stage and hence can share the same ETs. We employ two different ETs: user-item embedding table (UIET) and the item embedding table (ItET). The UIET holds user-item features used by the filtering and ranking stage. Some UIETs are exclusively used by the filtering or the ranking stage while some UIETs are shared by the two stages. The item characteristics are stored in the ItET. To conserve memory space, the ItET can be accessed by both the filtering and the ranking stage.\nFor the UIETs, ET lookups and pooling operations are done in the filtering and ranking stage, respectively. For the ItET, two primary operations are required: (i) lookups and pooling on the ET to transform a sparse input feature into a dense vector; (ii) the NNS\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>IMARS<|>CONCEPT<|>iMARS is an architecture designed for recommendation systems (RecSys) that utilizes an in-memory computing (IMC) fabric to accelerate deep neural network (DNN) operations and embedding table (ET) related tasks during the filtering and ranking stages of RecSys.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DNN STACK<|>CONCEPT<|>The DNN stack refers to a series of deep neural network layers used in machine learning models, particularly in recommendation systems, to process and analyze data.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMBEDDING TABLES<|>CONCEPT<|>Embedding tables (ETs) are data structures used to store and retrieve user-item features in recommendation systems, facilitating the transformation of sparse input features into dense vectors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CROSSBAR ARRAYS<|>CONCEPT<|>Crossbar arrays are hardware structures that efficiently implement matrix-vector multiplications, making them suitable for accelerating DNN models.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CMA ARRAYS<|>CONCEPT<|>CMA arrays are combined memory arrays that integrate multiple functionalities, such as those of TCAM and GPCiM, within the same physical structure for enhanced computational efficiency.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USER-ITEM EMBEDDING TABLE (UIET)<|>CONCEPT<|>The user-item embedding table (UIET) is a specific type of embedding table that holds user-item features utilized in both the filtering and ranking stages of recommendation systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ITEM EMBEDDING TABLE (ItET)<|>CONCEPT<|>The item embedding table (ItET) stores characteristics of items and can be accessed by both the filtering and ranking stages in recommendation systems to optimize memory usage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GPCIMS<|>CONCEPT<|>GPCiMs are general-purpose computing in memory systems that perform Boolean logic and arithmetic operations within RAM, utilizing specialized memory cells for current-based operations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TCAMS<|>CONCEPT<|>TCAMs (Ternary Content Addressable Memories) are specialized memory structures that perform row-wise sensing for fast data retrieval based on content matching.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FEFETS<|>CONCEPT<|>FeFETs (Ferroelectric Field-Effect Transistors) are a type of transistor that incorporates a ferroelectric material in its gate stack, enhancing performance in various IMC-based circuits.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IMARS<|>DNN STACK<|>The iMARS architecture is designed to accelerate operations within the DNN stack, improving the efficiency of recommendation systems.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IMARS<|>EMBEDDING TABLES<|>iMARS utilizes embedding tables to manage user-item features during the filtering and ranking stages of recommendation systems.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CROSSBAR ARRAYS<|>DNN STACK<|>Crossbar arrays are employed within the DNN stack of the iMARS architecture to facilitate efficient matrix-vector multiplications.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CMA ARRAYS<|>EMBEDDING TABLES<|>CMA arrays are used in conjunction with embedding tables to optimize the processing of ET-related operations in the iMARS architecture.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>USER-ITEM EMBEDDING TABLE (UIET)<|>EMBEDDING TABLES<|>The UIET is a specific type of embedding table that is utilized in both the filtering and ranking stages of recommendation systems.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ITEM EMBEDDING TABLE (ItET)<|>EMBEDDING TABLES<|>The ItET is another type of embedding table that stores item characteristics and is accessed during the filtering and ranking stages.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GPCIMS<|>CMA ARRAYS<|>GPCiMs can be integrated with CMA arrays to perform general-purpose computations within the same hardware structure, enhancing efficiency.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TCAMS<|>CMA ARRAYS<|>TCAMs can be combined with CMA arrays to provide additional functionalities in memory structures, allowing for versatile operations.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FEFETS<|>CMA ARRAYS<|>FeFETs are used in CMA arrays to improve performance and compatibility with CMOS fabrication processes in IMC-based circuits.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
