The condition for equality is if and only if 𝑑 * 𝑔 = 1 and the 𝑣 is the unique neighbor of node 𝑢, i.e., 𝛾 = 1 and 𝐶 = 1. □ Theorem 4.3 shows that the node influence using HMP exponentially decays as the shortest graph distance 𝑑 * 𝑔 between two nodes increases. In other words, distant nodes in dense areas will have less interaction, even if they are in a dense connected area. To alleviate the phenomenon, we propose a Curvature-based Homophily Constraint (𝜅HC) to enhance the connection within linked pairs. The basic idea is to push the embeddings of linked nodes closer if their ORC value is larger than a threshold.
