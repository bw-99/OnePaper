According to the above extensive experiments, we are safe to conclude that equipping ORC with hyperbolic geometry further improves its generalization ability, obtaining high-quality representations for both tree-like and non-tree-like structured data. This confirms our primary motivation that the curvature carries rich information which is beneficial for graph representation learning in the embedding manifold. Specifically, incorporating the structure information featured by ORC helps the models developed in a continuous manifold with negative curvature to perceive the role of each node, accelerating the learning procedure, and reducing the distortion for graph embedding of less hierarchical networks. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b0', 'b77', 'b34', 'b82', 'b27', 'b1'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_3', 'tab_4', 'tab_3'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Effectiveness of Aggregations </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In Section 4.1, we introduce two tangential aggregation strategies: the curvature-based approach (denoted as Curv) and the featureaugmented method (denoted as CurvAtt). The performance of  these two aggregation strategies is evaluated and reported in Table 5. Our results show that the feature-augmented approach outperforms the curvature-based one in most cases, which can be attributed to the complex nature of real-world systems and the incongruities between node features and topology. The feature-augmented method offers a more flexible and adaptive way to synthesize information from various sources, thus resulting in improved performance. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_5'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Effectiveness of 𝜅HC </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Figure 5 displays the results of adding 𝜅HC or not on 𝜅HGCN. As it observed, the performance degenerates substantially on DISEASE when applying 𝜅HC, while there are significant improvements on the three citation networks, i.e., PubMed, and Cora. This phenomenon can be understood as follows. Adding 𝜅HC as in node classification will force linked nodes to obtain more similar representations. For the pure tree-like dataset, i.e., DISEASE (without any triangle and circle), these node pairs belong to different levels, and adding 𝜅HC impairs the learning of asymmetric dependencies, which further affects the establishment of hierarchical awareness. When it comes to the citation networks instead, 𝜅HC helps to reduce the distortion caused by hyperbolic geometry and thus boost the learning. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_3'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Case Study of Ricci Curvature Weights </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In this section, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a case study. We extract a subtree centered on a randomly sampled node (node 10, in this case), from the Disease dataset, where node 2 is from a higher level and the remaining nodes (42,43,44,45) belong to a lower level. The edges depict disease propagation paths. As shown in the upper sub-figures of Figure 6, we display the corresponding edge weights assigned by both 𝜅HGCN and HGCN during the node classification task. The comparison between the two reveals that 𝜅HGCN (upper right) effectively distinguishes node levels, as it assigns greater importance to the parent node (node 2) and equally emphasizes the child nodes from the same level, whereas HGCN (upper left) fails to make such distinctions. This substantiates the importance of ORC in facilitating hierarchical learning.\nFurthermore, we illustrate a subgraph with triangles selected from the citation network, Cora, as depicted in the lower two sub-figures of Figure 6. This subgraph comprises nodes 𝑜, 𝑒, 𝑑 that form a triangle. We examine the edge weights around node 𝑜 and present the results in the lower two sub-figures of Figure 6. Observing these results, it is evident that 𝜅HGCN (as shown in the lower right) effectively identifies the local triangle structure and assigns larger weights to promote inter-node message exchange. In contrast, HGCN (as depicted in the lower left) fails to grasp the intricate topology in this area. These observations further attest to the efficacy of our proposed method in uncovering local clusters and mitigating the distortions imposed by hyperbolic geometry. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b41', 'b42', 'b43', 'b44'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_4', 'fig_4', 'fig_4'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>CONCLUSION </p><h2>text</h2> <p>For\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
