Table 4 provides an enumeration of fix patterns used in this work. For more implementation details, we refer the reader to our replication package. All tools and data are released as open source to the community to foster further research into these directions. As illustrated in Figure 3, a fix pattern encodes the recipe of change actions that should be applied to mutate a code element.  For a given reported bug, once our fault localizer yields its list of suspicious statements, iFixR iteratively attempts to select fix patterns for each statement. The selection of fix patterns is conducted in a naïve way based on the context information of each suspicious statement (i.e., all nodes in its abstract syntax tree, AST). Specifically, iFixR parses the code and traverses each node of the suspicious statement AST from its first child node to its last leaf node in a breadth-first strategy (i.e, left-to-right and top-to-bottom). If a node matches the context a fix pattern (i.e., same AST node types), the fix pattern will be applied to generate patch candidates by mutating the matched code entity following the recipe in the fix pattern. Whether the node matches a fix pattern or not, iFixR keeps traversing its children nodes and searches fix patterns for them to generate patch candidates successively. This process is iteratively performed until leaf nodes are encountered.\nConsider the example of bug Math-75 illustrated in Figure 4. iFixR parses the buggy statement (i.e., statement at line 302 in the file Frequency.java) into an AST as illustrated by Figure 5. First, iFixR matches a fix pattern that can mutate the expression in the return statement with other expression(s) returning data of type double. It further selects fix patterns for the direct child node (i.e., method invocation: getCumPct((Comparable<?> v))) of the return statement. This method invocation can be matched against fix patterns with two contexts: method name and parameter(s). With the breadth-first strategy, iFixR assigns a fix pattern, calling another method with the same parameters (cf. PAR [26, page 804]), to mutate the method name, and then selects fix patterns to mutate the parameter. Furthermore, iFixR will match fix patterns for the type and variable of the cast expression respectively and successively.  </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b25', 'b50', 'b17', 'b13', 'b17', 'b25', 'b30', 'b45', 'b47', 'b48', 'b50', 'b59', 'b72', 'b25', 'b47'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_5'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_6'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Patch Validation with Regression Testing </p><h2>text</h2> <p>For every reported bug, fault localization followed by pattern matching and code mutation will yield a set of patch candidates. In a typical test-based APR system, these patch candidates must let the program pass all test cases (including some positive test cases [83], which encode the actual functional requirements relevant to the bug). Thus, the patch candidates set is actively pruned to remove all patches that do not meet these requirements. In our work, in accordance with our investigation findings that such test cases may\nReturnStatement \"raw_code\" MethodInvocation \"raw_code\" MethodName \"getCumPct\" CastExpression \"raw_code\"\nType \"Comparable<?>\" VariableName \"v\" ① ② ③ ④ ⑤\n*\"raw_code\" denotes the corresponding source code at the related node position.\nFigure 5: AST of bug Math-75 source code statement. not be available at the time the bug is reported (cf. Section 2), we assume that iFixR cannot reason about future test cases to select patch candidates.\nInstead, we rely only on past test cases, which were available in the code base, when the bug is reported. Such test cases are leveraged to perform regression testing [95], which will ensure that, at least, the selected patches do not obstruct the behavior of the existing, unchanged part of the software, which is already explicitly encoded by developers in their current test suite. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b82', 'b94'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Output: Patch Recommendation List </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Eventually, iFixR produces a ranked recommendation list of patch suggestions for developers. Until now, the order of patches is influenced mainly by two steps in the workflow:\n(1) localization: our statement-level IRFL yields a ranked list of statements to modify in priority. (2) pattern matching: the AST node of the buggy code entity is broken down into its children and iteratively navigated in a breadth-first manner to successively produce candidate patches. Eventually, the produced list of patches has an order, which carries the biases of fault localization [48], and is noised by the pre-set breadth-first strategy for matching fix patterns. We thus design an ordering process with a function 3 , f r cmd : 2 P → P k , as follows:\nf r cmd (patches) = (pri type • pri susp • pri chanдe )(patches) (1\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
