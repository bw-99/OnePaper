Hyperbolic feature transformation is formulated as: </p><h2>text</h2> <p>h ℓ,H 𝑖 = W ℓ ⊗ 𝜅 ℓ -1 x ℓ -1,H 𝑖 ⊕ 𝜅 ℓ -1 b ℓ ,(5)\nwhere ℓ denotes the ℓ-th layer, W is the trainable matrix and b is the bias.\nW ⊗ 𝜅 x := exp 𝜅 o (W log 𝜅 o (x)) and x ⊕ 𝜅 b := exp 𝜅\nx (𝑃𝑇 𝜅 o→x (b)) are matrix-vector multiplication and bias translation operations in hyperbolic space, respectively. The superscript H denotes the hyperbolic feature. space of the origin:\nhℓ,H 𝑖 = exp 𝜅 𝑙 -1 o ∑︁ 𝑗 ∈ N 𝑖 κ𝑖,𝑗 • log 𝜅 𝑙 -1 o (h ℓ,H 𝑗 ) .(6)\nHere κ𝑖,𝑗 denotes the curvature for capturing the local structure, computed by softmax operation within the neighbors N 𝑖 (N 𝑖 contains the node self):\nκ𝑖,𝑗 = softmax 𝑗 ∈ N (𝑖 ) MLP(𝜅 𝑖,𝑗 ) ,(7)\nwhere 𝜅 𝑖,𝑗 is the raw ORC value, and MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) is employed to make the curvature more adaptive to the overall negative curvature. This approach is referred to as Curv. When it comes to the case where the topology information and node features are inconsistent to a certain degree, e.g., the network is quite sparse or depends more on the node features, inspired by [94], we propose a feature-attention enhanced aggregation (CurvAtt), which encodes node state into the curvature:\nκ′ 𝑖,𝑗 = 𝑤 𝜅 κ𝑖,𝑗 + 𝑤 𝛼 𝛼 𝑖,𝑗 𝑤 𝜅 + 𝑤 𝛼 ,(8)\nwhere 𝛼 𝑖,𝑗 is hyperbolic feature attention, 𝑤 𝜅 and 𝑤 𝛼 are the trainable parameters that adjust structure information and feature correlation with the initial value 1.0. The hyperbolic feature attention 𝛼 𝑖,𝑗 is defined as:\n𝛼 𝑖,𝑗 = softmax 𝑗 ∈ N 𝑖 MLP(log 𝜅 o (h H 𝑖 )∥ log 𝜅 o (h H 𝑗 )) .(9)\n4.1.3 Hyperbolic Non-linear Activation. After that, we apply a nonlinear activation:\nx ℓ,H 𝑖 = 𝜎 𝜅 ℓ -1 ,𝜅 ℓ ( hℓ,H ) = exp 𝜅 ℓ o 𝜎 (log 𝜅 ℓ -1 o ( hℓ,H )) . (10\n)\nGeometric Intuition. The real-world tree-like graphs with heterogeneous local structures are inevitably distorted if we directly embed them into a homogeneous manifold. For instance, the embedding of quasi-cycle graphs such as 𝑛 × 𝑛 square lattices (zero curvature) and 𝑛-node cycles (positive curvature) incur at least a multiplicative distortion of 𝑂 (𝑛/log 𝑛) in hyperbolic space [79]. Graph Ricci curvature is able to mitigate this distortion. The geometric intuition is that the more positive the curvature is, the more two distance balls centered at nearby points overlap, and therefore, the cheaper it is to transport the mass from one to the other. Theoretical results show that with the increasing number of triangles involved in the linked pair (𝑖, 𝑗), the lower bound of curvature will be increased [33], as stated in Theorem 4.1. It is easy to understand because when the two vertices share many triangles, then the transportation distance should be smaller, and the curvature, therefore, is correspondingly larger. Theorem 4.1 (Lower bound of ORC [33]). On a locally finite graph, for any pair of neighboring vertices i, j, let #(𝑖, 𝑗) := number of triangles which include 𝑖, 𝑗 as vertices for 𝑖 ∼ 𝑗. Then, we have the inequality, saying that\n𝜅 𝑖,𝑗 ≥ -1 - 1 𝑑 𝑖 - 1 𝑑 𝑗 - #(𝑖, 𝑗) 𝑑 𝑖 ∧ 𝑑 𝑗 + -1 - 1 𝑑 𝑖 - 1 𝑑 𝑗 - #(𝑖, 𝑗) 𝑑 𝑖 ∨ 𝑑 𝑗 + + #(𝑖, 𝑗) 𝑑 𝑖 ∨ 𝑑 𝑗 , (11\n)\nwhere 𝑠 + := max(𝑠, 0), 𝑠 ∨ 𝑡 := max(𝑠, 𝑡), 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑠 ∧ 𝑡 := min(𝑠, 𝑡).\nIn this study,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
