Our second hypothesis (2) posits that data sparsity can lead to sub-optimal mixtures of embeddings, and that nearest-neighbor smoothing can mitigate this. Our experiments support this hypothesis, as we see a 25% relative improvement for HEP-TH in R@10, and 35% for DBLP and when using kNN-Embed. We see similar significant improvements over baselines in R@20 and R@50. For Twitter-Follow, the improvements in recall are dramatic -534% in relative terms going from unimodal embeddings to a mixture of embeddings in R@10. We suspect this significant improvement is because Twitter-Follow simultaneously has a much higher average degree than HEP-TH and DBLP and the number of unique nodes is much larger. It is a more difficult task to embed so many items, from many different interest clusters, in close proximity to a user. As such, we see a massive improvement by explicitly querying from each user's interest clusters. Applying smoothing provides an additional 74% in relative terms, and similar behaviours are observed in R@20 and R@50. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b1'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_2'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Diversity: </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We apply Equation 8 to retrieved candidates and measure the spread of retrieved candidates' embedding vectors. As seen in Table 2, the candidates from unimodal retrieval are less diverse than candidates retrieved via multiple queries from mixture representations. This verifies our first research hypothesis that unimodal embeddings may retrieve many items that are clustered closely together as a by-product of ANN retrieval (i.e., diversity and recall is low). However, multiple queries from mixtures of embeddings broadens the search spatially; retrieved items are from different clusters, which are more spread out from each other. kNN-Embed (i.e., smooth mixture retrieval) results in slightly less diverse candidates than unsmoothed mixture retrieval. We posit that this is due to the high-variance of the maximum likelihood estimator of the p mle (c|u j ) multinomial (Equation 3). While this high-variance may yield more diverse candidates, this yields less relevant candidates as seen in Table 1 where kNN-Embed consistently yields better recall than unsmoothed mixture retrieval. While high diversity is necessary for high recall, it is insufficient on its own.  </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_4', 'tab_2'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Goodness of Fit: </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We evaluate how well unimodal, mixture, and smoothed mixture embeddings model a user's interests. The main idea is that the better fit a user representation is, the closer it will be to the distribution of held out relevant items for that user. As seen in Table 3, the results validate the idea that unimodal user embeddings do not model user interests as well as mixtures over multiple embeddings. Multiple embeddings yield a significant EMD improvement over a single embedding vector when evaluated on held-out items. Smoothing further decreases the EMD which we posit is due to the smoothed embedding mixtures being lower-variance estimates as they leverage engagement data from similar users in constructing the representations. These results suggest that the higher recall of smoothed mixtures is due to better user preferences modeling.  </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>['tab_5'] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Hyper-parameter Sensitivity Analysis: </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We focus on recall as the sine qua non of candidate retrieval problems and analyze hyper-parameters on HEP-TH. In Figure 3a, we vary the smoothing parameter λ (same parameter for both the mixture probabilities and the cluster centroids) and see heavy smoothing improves performance significantly. This likely stems from the sparsity of HEP-TH where most papers have only a few citations. In Figure 3b, we vary the number of embeddings (i.e., the mixture size) and notice improved performance saturating at six mixture components. Out of all the hyperparameters, this seems to be the critical one in achieving high recall. In practice, latency constraints can be considered when selecting the number of embeddings per user, explicitly making the trade-off between diversity and latency.    </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_3', 'fig_3'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Conclusions </p><h2>text</h2> <p>We present kNN-Embed, a method of transforming single user dense embeddings, into mixtures of embeddings, with the goal of better modeling user interests, increasing retrieval recall and diversity.
