Many techniques aim to solve this issue by feature selection or embedding dimension search. However, these techniques typically select a fixed subset of features or embedding dimensions for all instances and feed all instances into one recommender model without considering heterogeneity between items or users. This paper proposes a novel instance-wise Hierarchical Architecture Search framework, iHAS, which automates neural architecture search at the instance level. Specifically, iHAS incorporates three stages: searching, clustering, and retraining. The searching stage identifies optimal instance-wise embedding dimensions across different field features via carefully designed Bernoulli gates with stochastic selection and regularizers. After obtaining these dimensions, the clustering stage divides samples into distinct groups via a deterministic selection approach of Bernoulli gates. The retraining stage then constructs different recommender models, each one designed with optimal dimensions for the corresponding group. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed iHAS on two public benchmark datasets from a real-world recommender system. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of iHAS and its outstanding transferability to widely-used deep recommendation models. </p><h1>sections</h1><h2>heading</h2> <p>INTRODUCTION </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Recommender systems, which aim to predict the preference of users, have been widely deployed in various real-world scenarios, e.g., online advertising [3,27], social media [9], news apps [39], etc. Deep learning recommendation models (DLRMs) typically take a large amount of categorical (e.g., gender) or numerical (e.g., age) field features as input. These features are first encoded into highdimensional sparse one-hot vectors, which are later mapped into real-valued dense vectors via embedding tables. The recommender model then feeds these embeddings into a feature interaction layer which usually consists of deep neural network (DNN) [6] or factorization machine (FM) [8,14,26,34] to model user preferences for final prediction.\nThe embedding tables play a fundamental role in the recommendation system, as they dominate the majority of parameters. However, most existing methods construct their proposed recommender models with large-sized embedding tables and a uniform dimension size for all possible fields [8,10,29], which may lead to overfitting, high computational cost, and poor model generalization [15,25,33]. Therefore, the first objective for an optimal DLRM is to find optimal embedding dimensions for different fields and remove redundant dimensions. Performing embedding dimension search is also sufficient to include feature selection, i.e., the optimal dimension for a field feature could be zero, which means completely excluding this feature.\nA common approach for embedding dimension search is to employ the l 0 norm on the dimensions to penalize the count of nonzero dimension entries. However, as the l 0 norm poses a computational challenge for gradient descent, researchers have attempted to substitute l 0 with a surrogate function, such as the l 1 norm for LASSO [32], yet achieving limited selection ability [35]. Recently, probabilistic approaches [18,33] suggest utilizing Bernoulli random variables (RVs) with Gumbel-Softmax approximations to identify the top 𝐾 features with the highest probabilities. Though these methods can be applied for dimension selection, we have empirically observed that the probabilities learned are often indistinguishable. Therefore, selecting the top 𝐾 features/dimensions based on these probabilities may inadvertently result in either the exclusion of critical features/dimensions or the inclusion of irrelevant ones.\nFurthermore, prior approaches uniformly apply embedding dimension selection across all instances in the datasets, therefore disregarding the inherent variations between individual samples. This one-size-for-all approach can be inadequate in many scenarios, especially when dealing with highly heterogeneous populations where relevant features can significantly diverge across users or across items. For example, in a movie recommendation system, the feature \"age\" usually plays a crucial role in recommending Disney movies, thereby possibly necessitating a larger embedding dimension. Conversely, \"age\" is less relevant for comedy films, resulting in a smaller dimension size. Thus, it is evident that treating all instances identically may overlook these context-specific nuances. Intuitively speaking, when dimension selection is performed at the instance level, we can create neural architectures that are better suited to individual samples. Such an approach not only results in superior performance but also enables faster inference times by focusing on the most relevant dimensions of each sample.\nIn this paper, we propose an instance-wise Hierarchical Architecture Search framework, iHAS, which attempts to perform automatic architecture search on the instance level, using hierarchical training procedures for DLRMs. Specifically, iHAS includes three learning stages: searching, clustering, and retraining. The searching stage aims to find the optimal instance-wise embedding dimensions across different fields via a carefully designed \"Bernoulli gate\" with stochastic selection mode and a regularizer. After selecting instancewise embedding dimensions, we separate samples into different groups based on a novel deterministic selection approach in the clustering stage. The retraining stage trains different recommender models, with optimal dimensions tailored to different groups. During inference time, each test sample will first be assigned to a suitable group, where predictions are made by the corresponding recommender model. We summarize our major contributions as:\n• We propose a hierarchical training framework that uses instance-wise \"Bernoulli gates\" to facilitate effective dimension search for each sample. • We apply a sparse and bi-polarization regularizer in the objective function to help the model learn distinguishable Bernoulli RVs, and use a threshold selector for downstream deterministic selection. • To balance the trade-off between the one-size-for-all and full-custom\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>IHAS<|>CONCEPT<|>iHAS is an instance-wise Hierarchical Architecture Search framework designed to automate neural architecture search at the instance level for recommender systems, improving performance by tailoring embedding dimensions to individual samples.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS<|>CONCEPT<|>Recommender systems are systems that predict user preferences and are widely used in various applications such as online advertising and social media.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEEP LEARNING RECOMMENDATION MODELS<|>CONCEPT<|>Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) utilize deep learning techniques to process large amounts of categorical and numerical features for predicting user preferences.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMBEDDING TABLES<|>CONCEPT<|>Embedding tables are structures that map high-dimensional sparse one-hot vectors into real-valued dense vectors, playing a crucial role in the performance of recommender systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FEATURE SELECTION<|>CONCEPT<|>Feature selection is the process of identifying and selecting a subset of relevant features for use in model construction, which can improve model performance and reduce overfitting.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERNOULLI GATES<|>CONCEPT<|>Bernoulli gates are mechanisms used in the iHAS framework for stochastic selection of embedding dimensions, allowing for effective dimension search tailored to individual samples.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLUSTERING<|>CONCEPT<|>Clustering is a stage in the iHAS framework that groups samples based on selected embedding dimensions, facilitating the creation of tailored recommender models.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RETRAINING<|>CONCEPT<|>Retraining is the final stage in the iHAS framework where different recommender models are trained with optimal dimensions for their respective groups.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IHAS<|>RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS<|>iHAS is designed to enhance the performance of recommender systems by automating architecture search at the instance level.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS<|>DEEP LEARNING RECOMMENDATION MODELS<|>Recommender systems often utilize deep learning recommendation models to process user data and improve prediction accuracy.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEEP LEARNING RECOMMENDATION MODELS<|>EMBEDDING TABLES<|>Deep learning recommendation models rely on embedding tables to convert categorical and numerical features into dense vectors for processing.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMBEDDING TABLES<|>FEATURE SELECTION<|>Effective feature selection can optimize the use of embedding tables by identifying the most relevant dimensions, thus improving model performance.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IHAS<|>BERNOULLI GATES<|>iHAS employs Bernoulli gates to perform stochastic selection of embedding dimensions, which is crucial for its instance-wise architecture search.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IHAS<|>CLUSTERING<|>The clustering stage in iHAS groups samples based on their selected embedding dimensions, which is essential for tailoring recommender models.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLUSTERING<|>RETRAINING<|>The retraining stage follows clustering in the iHAS framework, where tailored recommender models are trained based on the groups formed during clustering.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
