Selections are represented by downsets. The latter are obtained when topologically sorting X and taking the first n elements, for any n. If µ is the counting measure, then po(x) is simply the number of elements that can be reached by following downwards the edges of the corresponding Hasse diagram. An example of such a relation represented by its Hasse diagram is depicted in Fig. 10.    Figure 13: Sorting 500 uniformly distributed points. Points in black belong to the first 10 equivalence classes (fronts). Note, that the total number of equivalence classes is larger for po-based sorting. The latter approach results in fewer ties.\nresults of sorting for uniformly distributed points, we observe that both sorting methods result in hyperbola-like selections, see Fig. 13. This means that sorting by Pareto fronts is more sensitive to the topological structure of the analyzed space, while sorting by po preserves its characteristics. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_7', 'fig_2', 'fig_2'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>B.2 Further Solutions of the Maximum Choice Problem </p><h2>text</h2> <p> </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Further similar solutions </p><h2>text</h2> <p>It is possible to prove that Theorem 1 also holds for T * k defined with a strict inequality (<) as follows, see Def. 5 for comparison.\nT * k = {x ∈ X| po(x) < k}. In this case, the proof of the fact that T * k is the largest in Lemma 1 requires analysis of inequality (4) instead of inequality (3). However, the proof of the fact that any selection T such that T * k ⊆ T ⊆ T k offers maximum choice for µ(T ) becomes a bit more technical. Moreover, it is possible to prove that T is the largest selection of this kind. Precisely, for any other selection S offering maximum choice for µ(T ), S ⊆ T for some T such that µ(T ) = µ(T ) and\nT * k ⊆ T ⊆ T k . </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Completeness of the Solutions </p><h2>text</h2> <p>In the case condition in Eq. ( 6) holds, and if for any selection S there is a k and there are selections T such that T * k ⊆ T ⊆ T k and µ(T ) = µ(S), then those selections T are the only selections offering maximum choice. Therefore, we have a complete list of selections offering maximum choice. This is the case for the typical example of the relation R defined in Section 2.3 and the Lebesgue area measure defined on the unit square [0, 1] 2 . This also holds for any discrete measure with constant non-zero weights, for example, for the counting measure on a finite set with a partial order relation. In the latter case, topologically sorting by increasing values of po and then taking the first n elements results in a set offering maximum choice. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Existence of Solutions of a Different Nature </p><h2>text</h2> <p>Let us consider again the example in Fig. 3.

If R is a transitive relation, then for any set of at least k-Pareto optimal elements T k such that µ(T k ) < +∞, we have\ndiv(T k ) = max S∈S,µ(S)=µ(T k ) div(S).\nMoreover T k is the unique such maximum.
