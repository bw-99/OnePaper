We will implicitly assume that all the higherpriority tasks are already verified and the required properties are already obtained. Therefore, this framework has to be applied for each of the given tasks. To ensure whether a task system is schedulable by the given scheduling policy, the test has to be applied for all the tasks. Of course, the results can be extended to test the schedulability of a task system in linear time complexity or to allow on-line admission control in constant time complexity if the schedulability condition (or with some more pessimistic simplifications) is monotonic. Such extensions are presented only for trivial cases.\nWe will only present the schedulability test of a certain task τ k , that is analyzed, under the above assumption. For notational brevity, in the framework presentation, we will implicitly assume that there are k-1 tasks, say τ 1 , τ 2 , . . . , τ k-1 with higher-priority than task τ k . We will use hp(τ k ) to denote the set of these k-1 higher-priority tasks, when their orderings do not matter. Moreover, we only consider the cases when k ≥ 2, since k = 1 is pretty trivial. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>k 2 Q </p><h2>text</h2> <p>This section presents the basic properties of the k 2 Q framework for testing the schedulability of task τ k in a given set of real-time tasks (depending on the specific models given in each application). Before presenting the framework, we first give a simple example to explain the underlying concepts by using an implicit-deadline sporadic task system τ , in which D i = T i for every τ i ∈ τ . The exact schedulability test to verify whether task τ k can meet its deadline under fixedpriority scheduling on uniprocessor systems is to check\n∃t with 0 < t ≤ T k and C k + τi∈hp(τ k ) t T i C i ≤ t,(1)\nwhere hp(τ k ) is the set of tasks with higher priority than τ k . Instead of testing all the time points t in the range of 0 and T k , for a sufficient schedulability test, we can greedily only consider to test the time points\n( T k Ti -1)T i for τ i ∈ hp(τ k ) and t = T k . If C k + τi∈hp(τ k )\nt Ti C i ≤ t holds in one of those k tested time points, then we can conclude that τ k can be feasibly scheduled under this scheduling policy.\nTo implement to above testing concept, we need two definitions: 1) Definition 1 defines the last release time ordering so that we can formulate the problem with linear algebra, 2) Definition 2 defines an abstracted schedulability test that can be used to model general schedulability tests regardless of the task and platform model. Definition 1 (Last Release Time Ordering). Let π be the last release time ordering assignment as a bijective function π : hp(τ k ) → {1, 2, . . . , k -1} to define the last release time ordering of task τ j ∈ hp(τ k ) in the window of interest. Last release time orderings are numbered from 1 to k -1, i.e., |hp(τ k )|, where 1 is the earliest and k -1 the latest.\nThe last release time ordering is a very important property in the whole framework. When testing the schedulability or analyzing the worst-case response time of task τ k , we do not need the priority ordering of the higher-priority tasks in hp(τ k ). But, we need to know how to order the k -1 higherpriority tasks so that we can formulate the test with simple and linear arithmetics based on the total order. For the rest of this paper, the ordering of the k -1 higher-priority tasks implicitly refers to their last release time ordering (except explanations regarding the last release time ordering when referring to Example 4). In the k 2 Q framework, we are only interested to test only k time points. More precisely, we are only interested to test whether task τ k can be successfully executed before the last release time of a higher-priority task in the testing window. Therefore, the last release time ordering provides a total order so that we can transform the schedulability tests into the following definition. Definition 2. A k-point last-release schedulability test under a given last release time ordering π of the k -1 higherpriority tasks is a sufficient schedulability test of a fixedpriority scheduling policy, that verifies the existence of t j with j = 1, 2, . . . , k such that\n0 ≤ t 1 ≤ t 2 ≤ • • • ≤ t k-1 ≤ t k and C k + k-1 i=1 α i t i U i + j-1 i=1 β i C\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ANALYSIS FLOW<|>CONCEPT<|>Analysis Flow is a framework that focuses on testing the schedulability and response time for tasks in a scheduling system, assuming higher-priority tasks are already verified.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCHEDULABILITY TEST<|>CONCEPT<|>A schedulability test is a method used to determine if a task can meet its deadlines under a specific scheduling policy, considering the properties of higher-priority tasks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>K2Q FRAMEWORK<|>CONCEPT<|>The k2Q framework is a specific approach for testing the schedulability of a task in a set of real-time tasks, particularly under fixed-priority scheduling on uniprocessor systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TASK<|>CONCEPT<|>A task is a unit of work that needs to be scheduled and executed within a system, often characterized by its execution time and deadline.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HIGHER-PRIORITY TASKS<|>CONCEPT<|>Higher-priority tasks are tasks that have precedence over other tasks in a scheduling system, affecting the schedulability of lower-priority tasks.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANALYSIS FLOW<|>SCHEDULABILITY TEST<|>The Analysis Flow framework is used to conduct schedulability tests for tasks within a scheduling system<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>K2Q FRAMEWORK<|>SCHEDULABILITY TEST<|>The k2Q framework provides a specific method for performing schedulability tests on tasks in real-time systems<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>K2Q FRAMEWORK<|>TASK<|>The k2Q framework is designed to analyze the schedulability of tasks in a scheduling environment<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HIGHER-PRIORITY TASKS<|>SCHEDULABILITY TEST<|>The properties of higher-priority tasks are essential for conducting schedulability tests on lower-priority tasks<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TASK<|>HIGHER-PRIORITY TASKS<|>Tasks can be categorized into higher-priority and lower-priority tasks, affecting their scheduling and execution<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
