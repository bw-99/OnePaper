We call these the unimodal embeddings, and assume that they model user-item relevance p(relevance|u j , i k ) = f (u j , i k ) for a suitable function f .\nGiven the input user-item engagement graph, our goal is to learn mixtures of embeddings representations of users that better capture the multiple interests of a user as evidenced by higher recall in a candidate retrieval task. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Unimodal User and Item Embeddings: </p><h2>text</h2> <p>While kNN-Embed presupposes a set of co-embedded user and item embeddings and is agnostic to the exact embedding technique used (the only constraint is that the embeddings must satisfy p(i k |u j ) = g(u j T i k ) for monotone g), for completeness we describe a simple approach we applied to co-embed users and items into the same space. We form a bipartite graph G of users and items, where an edge represents relevance (e.g., user follows content producer). We seek to learn an embedding vector (i.e., vector of learnable parameters) for each user (u j ) and item (i k ) in this bipartite graph; we denote these learnable embeddings for users and items as u j and i k respectively. A user-item pair is scored with a scoring function of the form f (u j , i k ). Our training objective seeks to learn u and i parameters that maximize a log-likelihood constructed from the scoring function for (u, i) ∈ G and minimize for (u, i) / ∈ G. For simplicity, we apply a dot product comparison between user and item representations. For a user-item pair e = (u j , i), this is defined by:\nf (e) = f (u j , i k ) = u j ⊺ i k(1)\nAs seen in Equation 1, we co-embed users and items by scoring their respective embedded representations via dot product and perform edge (or link) prediction. We consume the input bipartite graph G as a set of user-item pairs of the form (u, i) which represent positive engagements between a user and item. The embedding training objective is to find user and item representations that are useful for predicting which users and items are linked via an engagement. While a softmax is a natural formulation to predict a user-item engagement, it is impractical due to the cost of computing the normalization over a large vocabulary of items. Following previous methods [22,10], negative sampling, a simplification of noise-contrastive estimation, can be used to learn the parameters u and i. We maximize the following negative sampling objective:\narg max u,i e∈G   log σ(f (e)) + e ′ ∈N (e) log σ(-f (e ′ ))  (2)\nwhere:\nN (u, i) = (u, i ′ ) : i ′ ∈ I ∪ (u ′ , i) : u ′ ∈ U . Equation 2 represents\nthe log-likelihood of predicting a binary \"real\" (edges in the network) or \"fake\" (negatively sampled edges) label. To maximize the objective, we learn u and i parameters to differentiate positive edges from negative, unobserved edges. Negative edges are sampled by corrupting positive edges via replacing either the user or item in an edge pair with a negatively sampled user or item. Following previous approaches, negative sampling is performed both uniformly and proportional to node prevalence in the training graph [4,18]. </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>['b21', 'b9', 'b3', 'b17'] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Smoothed Mixture of Embeddings </p><h2>text</h2> <p>To use embeddings for candidate retrieval, we need a method of selecting relevant items given the input user. Ideally, we would like to construct a full distribution over all items for each user p(i k |u j ) and draw samples from it. The sheer number of items makes this difficult to do efficiently, especially when candidate retrieval strategies are meant to be light-weight. In practice, the most common method is to greedily select the top few most relevant items using an ANN search with the unimodal user embedding as query. A significant weakness of this greedy selection is that, by its nature, ANN search will return items that are similar not only to the user embedding, but also to each other; this drastically reduces the diversity of the returned items. This reduction in diversity is a side-effect of the way embeddings are trained -typically, the goal of training embeddings is to put users and relevant items close in Euclidean space; however, this also places similar users close in space, as well as similar items. We will repeatedly exploit this \"locality implies similarity\" property of embeddings in this paper to resolve this diversity issue.\nClustering Items: Since neighboring items are similar in the embedding space, if we apply a distance-based clustering to items, we can arrive at groupings that represent individual user preferences well. As such, we first cluster items using spherical k-means [6] where cluster centroids are placed on a high-dimensional sphere with radius one.
