The factor view in Figure 2(b) visualizes an initial collection of factors using the ELNetApp model. It can be seen in the factor view that many factors are quite stable over time. Different from the study on individual stocks, for portfolio construction, the manager would like to select both valuable factors and a set of stocks whose selected factors behave in a similarly stable and effective way. Our tool provides support with an interactive selection process. Users can click on each important factor in the factor list (Figure 2(d)) and scroll in the stock view (Figure 2(c)) to identify candidate stocks. By this process, the manager found factor lagretn, which had a moderate overall contribution to stock returns of the sector (Figure 2(d)) and the contribution was stable on several individual stocks. As shown in Figure 6(a), the selected stocks share similar patterns on lagretn. When the stock price started to rise again from September (notice red/green bars in Figure 2(c)), the contribution of lagretn reversed to negative and stayed for few months, as shown by the connecting lines in Figure 6(a). It is found in Figure 6(b) that five stocks (red lines) sharing this pattern on lagretn receive excess returns above the sector average (blue line). The prediction performance in Figure 6(c) (grey dotted line) also surpasses the market average (blue dotted line).\nThe manager proceeded to interactively examine all the five selected stocks. In the factor list view, he checked again all the candidate factors and found the factor std dvol, which had a favorable pattern as the factor lagretn on all the selected stocks. After applying the two factors together (Figure 2(d)), the stock returns were re-computed and updated in Figure 2(e). One stock appeared to receive less return after adding the second factor, while all the other four stocks remained superior to the sector average. In the backtesting view (Figure 2(f)), the final portfolio of two factors and four stocks (red lines) turned out to be better than the single-factor portfolio (grey lines) in both the backtest performance in 2015 (solid lines) and an outlook in the first three months of 2016 (dotted lines).\nIn another study, we asked the manager to work in the Household Appliances sector in the same year of 2015. By repeating a similar process, he was able to build a two-factor model of size+retnmax. Three stocks having stable contributions were selected. The portfolio returns in both 2015 and 2016 (outlook) are better than the market average. We omit screenshots due to the space limit.\nBy comparing the visual analysis result in the above two sectors, it is noticed that the Appliance sector is almost exclusively influenced by the transaction factors, while the Chemical sector is influenced by transaction factors and other types of factors such as momentum, value, and growth (Figure 2(d)). We hypothesize that because of their relationship, the Chemical sector is not only affected by transactions in the stock market but also linked to the price of crude oil, which is independently traded.  </p><h2>publication_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>figure_ref</h2> <p>['fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_7', 'fig_2', 'fig_7', 'fig_7', 'fig_7', 'fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2', 'fig_2'] </p><h2>table_ref</h2> <p>[] </p><h2>heading</h2> <p>Discussion </p><h2>text</h2> <p>The sparse regression model and its flexibility. In our system, users routinely start from an initial set of factors recommended by the build-in sparse regression model, which potentially limits the flexibility of factor investing by iQUANT . This issue is alleviated from three directions: in the factor list view (Figure 2(d)), users can manually select any set of factors as the starting point of analysis; the sparsity parameter of the regression model (λ ) can be tuned in the backend to offer more or less initial factors; finally, the iQUANT system is fully compatible with any other sparse models or a combination of feature selection and prediction models.\nThe joint human-model approach and its advantage. We have mentioned in previous sections, the model-only approach in factor selection suffers from the interpretability issue. Traders need to understand the factor before applied in practice. Also, a human is better in a heuristic search of the best combination within the vast factor space. More importantly, in the financial domain, there is no model that works in the long term. It will be critical to have human stand by models, and would be better to early adjust accordingly.\nThe visual design and its learning curve. Notice that stock traders may not have a strong background in visualization. Thus, we tried to strike a balance between the intuitiveness and expressiveness of visualization. On one hand, classical designs such as bar charts and line charts are employed in iQUANT , due to their intuitiveness and users' familiarity. On the other hand, our designs are tailored to the target users. For example in the factor view, green/red are used to indicate the decline/rise of stock prices, according to the convention of our target market. The effectiveness of iQUANT design is confirmed by the user study result and expert feedback. Most subjects found iQUANT easy to learn and understand.\nThe user study and its design choices.
