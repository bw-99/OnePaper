Therefore, the final embedding of the input data 𝑿 𝑖 through 𝑁 embedding tables is\n𝑬 𝑖 = [𝒆 𝑖,1 , • • • , 𝒆 𝑖,𝑛 , • • • , 𝒆 𝑖,𝑁 ].\nNotably, the embedding dimension search techniques we discussed earlier in Section 2.2 (also the focus of this paper) aim at searching the optimal dimensions for embedding tables\n𝑽 = [𝒗 1 , • • • , 𝒗 𝑛 , • • • , 𝒗 𝑁 ].\nSpecifically, our goal is to discover the optimal individual embedding dimension for each field, given the inherent diversity in the heterogeneous dataset. This could potentially enhance prediction performance.<h2>publication_ref</h2>[]<h2>figure_ref</h2>[]<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>MLP Component.<h2>text</h2>The MLP component plays a crucial role in DLRMs, tasked with encoding embedding representations and predicting the recommendation. Empirically, it comprises multiple fully-connected (FC) layers (characterized by parameter 𝜽 ) and is also equipped with non-linear activation functions such as ReLU [1] or Sigmoid, thereby facilitating the nonlinear encoding process of these representations.\nIn the iHAS system, we will train three different DLRMs, as illustrated in Figure 1. Each DLRM consists of an embedding layer and an MLP component. These three models are named the base recommender model, recommender model 1, and recommender model 2, which are characterized by the parameter groups {𝑽, 𝜽 } 𝑏 , {𝑽, 𝜽 } 1 , and {𝑽, 𝜽 } 2 , respectively.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b0']<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_0']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Bernoulli Gates<h2>text</h2>Bernoulli gates operate as switches, facilitating the transmission of a sample's information from embedding tables to the downstream MLP component. Analogous to the l 0 norm, we hope these \"switches\" to be capable of fully opening or closing without compromising the information integrity (shrinking the embedding representation). Inspired by the approach presented in [18,35], we use Bernoulli gates to predict each sample's relevant dimensions given its embedding representation. The detailed process of the Bernoulli gates is graphically depicted in Figure 2.\nThe Bernoulli gates operate in two distinct modes: stochastic selection and deterministic selection. Under the stochastic selection mode, the gates operate as independent Bernoulli distributions, to independently \"open\" or \"close\" dimensions given the probabilities. The principle behind stochastic selection rests on the assumption that, given a sufficiently large number of training iterations, the gates will stochastically and comprehensively traverse all potential combinations of dimensions. This prompts the Bernoulli parameters to increase for beneficial dimensions and penalize unhelpful ones. Once the Bernoulli distributions (gates) have been fully explored, we capitalize on the learned distribution by deterministically opening the most advantageous dimensions in the deterministic selection mode. However, learned Bernoulli probabilities often exhibit heavy-tailedness, making it challenging to distinguish between important and unimportant dimensions. To mitigate this, we suggest employing a polarization regularizer and an automatic threshold searcher (both discussed in Section 3.3.3) inside Bernoulli gates.<h2>publication_ref</h2>['b17', 'b34']<h2>figure_ref</h2>['fig_1']<h2>table_ref</h2>[]<h2>heading</h2>Stochastic Selection.<h2>text</h2>In our previous discussion, we aim for Bernoulli gates to function as independent Bernoulli distributions in the stochastic selection mode during the searching stage. The first objective is to encode the embedding representations to the desired independent Bernoulli probabilities. To this end, we employ an FC layer (with parameter 𝒘) and a Sigmoid activation layer (𝜎) to project these embedding representations of the 𝑖-th sample onto Bernoulli probabilities (upper left of Figure 2), denoted by {𝑝 𝑖,𝑗 } 𝑁 * 𝑗=1 = 𝜎 (𝒘 𝑬 𝑖 ), where 𝑁 * = 𝑁 × 𝑑 is the total length of the embedding representations. This enables us to initiate a combinatorial search process over the space of Bernoulli probabilities and FC parameters. However, optimizing a loss function, which includes discrete RVs (Bernoulli distributions), incurs high variance [23]. To overcome this obstacle, we adopt Gumbel-Softmax [11] (aka\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
