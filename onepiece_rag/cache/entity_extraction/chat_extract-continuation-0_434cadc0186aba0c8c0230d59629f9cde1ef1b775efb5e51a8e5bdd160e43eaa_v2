Theorem 4.2 (Embedding Distance w.r.t ORC). Let (𝑖, 𝑗) ∈ 𝐸 be the linked pair, h 𝑖 , h 𝑗 ∈ R 𝑑 be the node state in the tangent space, 𝑑 𝑖 be the degree of node 𝑖, and 𝐷 be the distance of node 𝑖 and node 𝑗 in the tangent space, that is\n𝐷 = ∥h 𝑖 -h 𝑗 ∥,(12)\nwhere ∥ • ∥ is the Euclidean norm. Define a large ORC as κ𝑖,𝑗 > max1/𝑑 𝑖 , 1/𝑑 𝑗  and a small ORC as κ𝑖,𝑗 < min1/𝑑 𝑖 , 1/𝑑 𝑗 . Then, when the large ORC is involved, their embedding distance will get smaller if using 𝜅HGCN. On the contrary, when the small ORC is involved, their embedding distance will get larger.\nProof. In the following, we use 𝐷 𝑙 and 𝐷 𝑠 to denote the distance when large and small curvature κ are involved, respectively. The main idea is that when there is a large curvature involved, the node distance will be decreased compared with the original case (degreebased aggregation), that is 𝐷 𝑙 < 𝐷. At the same time, when there is a small curvature involved, the node distance will increase, that is 𝐷 𝑠 > 𝐷.\n(1) When a large curvature (i.e., 𝜅 𝑖,𝑗 > max(1/𝑑 𝑖 , 1/𝑑 𝑗 )) is involved, more messages will be transferred, and we decompose the embedding, taking h 𝑖 as an example, into two components: one is from original h 𝑖 and another is the incremental parts from h 𝑗 , then\n𝐷 𝑙 = ∥(h 𝑖 + 𝛼 𝑖 h 𝑗 ) -(h 𝑗 + 𝛼 𝑗 h 𝑖 )∥ = ∥(h 𝑖 -𝛼 𝑗 h 𝑖 ) -(h 𝑗 -𝛼 𝑖 h 𝑗 )∥,(13)\nwhere 𝛼 𝑖 (𝛼 𝑗 ) is the difference between κ𝑖,𝑗 and 1/𝑑 𝑖 ( 1/𝑑 𝑗 ), i.e., 𝛼 𝑖 = κ𝑖,𝑗 -1/𝑑 𝑖 , 𝛼 𝑗 = κ𝑖,𝑗 -1/𝑑 𝑗 . Since κ𝑖,𝑗 > max(1/𝑑 𝑖 , 1/𝑑 𝑗 ), 𝛼 𝑖 and 𝛼 𝑗 are both positive. Let 𝛼 𝑖 𝑗 = 𝛼 𝑖 ≈ 𝛼 𝑗 , then\n𝐷 𝑙 ≈ ∥(h 𝑖 -𝛼 𝑖 𝑗 h 𝑖 ) -(h 𝑗 -𝛼 𝑖 𝑗 h 𝑗 )∥ = (1 -𝛼 𝑖 𝑗 )∥h 𝑖 -h 𝑗 ∥ < 𝐷.(14)\nThen, we easily know that when large curvature is involved, the distance will be reduced and two nodes will be closer to each other. What's more, the larger the curvature, the closer the nodes are.\n(2) Similarly, when a small curvature (𝜅 𝑖,𝑗 < min(1/𝑑 𝑖 , 1/𝑑 𝑗 )) is involved, fewer messages will be transferred, and we decompose the embedding, taking h 𝑖 as an example, into two components: one is from original h 𝑖 and another is the reduction parts of h 𝑗 , that is\n𝐷 𝑠 = ∥(h 𝑖 -𝛽 𝑖 h 𝑗 ) -(h 𝑗 -𝛽 𝑗 h 𝑖 )∥ ≈ (1 + 𝛽 𝑖 𝑗 )∥h 𝑖 -h 𝑗 ∥ > 𝐷,(15)\nwhere 𝛽 𝑖 is the difference between 1/𝑑 𝑖 and κ𝑖,𝑗 , i.e., 𝛽 𝑖 = 1/𝑑 𝑖 -κ𝑖,𝑗 , 𝛽 𝑗 = 1/𝑑 𝑗 -κ𝑖,𝑗 . Both 𝛽 𝑖 and 𝛽 𝑗 are positive in that 𝜅 𝑖,𝑗 < min(1/�\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>THEOREM 4.2<|>CONCEPT<|>Theorem 4.2 is a theoretical analysis that discusses the relationship between ORC (Optimality Ratio Condition) and embedding distance in the context of linked nodes in a mathematical framework.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORC<|>CONCEPT<|>ORC stands for Optimality Ratio Condition, which is a measure used to evaluate the curvature involved in the relationships between linked nodes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMBEDDING DISTANCE<|>CONCEPT<|>Embedding distance refers to the distance between nodes in a tangent space, which is influenced by the curvature of the nodes and their relationships.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NODE STATE<|>CONCEPT<|>Node state refers to the representation of a node in the tangent space, denoted as h_i and h_j in the context of the analysis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TANGENT SPACE<|>CONCEPT<|>Tangent space is a mathematical construct that represents the local linear approximation of a manifold at a given point, used here to analyze node relationships.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEGREE OF NODE<|>CONCEPT<|>Degree of node refers to the number of connections or edges associated with a node, denoted as d_i in the analysis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CURVATURE<|>CONCEPT<|>Curvature in this context refers to the measure of how much a curve deviates from being a straight line, affecting the embedding distance between nodes.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THEOREM 4.2<|>ORC<|>Theorem 4.2 analyzes the relationship between ORC and embedding distance, demonstrating how curvature affects the distance between linked nodes.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ORC<|>EMBEDDING DISTANCE<|>The Optimality Ratio Condition (ORC) influences the embedding distance between nodes, with large curvature leading to smaller distances and small curvature leading to larger distances.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NODE STATE<|>EMBEDDING DISTANCE<|>The node states h_i and h_j are used to calculate the embedding distance in the tangent space, indicating a direct relationship.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEGREE OF NODE<|>CURVATURE<|>The degree of a node (d_i) is used to define the conditions for large and small curvature in the analysis, establishing a relationship between these concepts.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TANGENT SPACE<|>EMBEDDING DISTANCE<|>The tangent space is the context in which embedding distance is measured, indicating a foundational relationship between these concepts.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
