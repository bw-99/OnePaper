-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-

Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:

entity_type: One of the following types: [RESEARCH PAPER, CONCEPT, ORGANIZATION]

entity_name: The specific name of the entity.

If the entity_type is 'RESEARCH PAPER,' format the name exactly as [doc_id:bx], where doc_id is the provided document identifier and x is the number within square brackets (e.g., [28] becomes [1:b28] for doc_id=1, [15] becomes [3:b15] for doc_id=3). For the current study, use [doc_id:b0] (e.g., [2:b0] for doc_id=2).
This naming rule for research papers is critical and must be followed without exception to ensure consistency and accuracy. Do not deviate from this rule under any circumstances.

If the entity_type is 'CONCEPT' or 'ORGANIZATION' use the name as it appears in the text.

entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:

source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1

target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1

relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other

relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use {record_delimiter} as the list delimiter.

If you have to translate into English, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

text: Mainly, smart transportation and traffic management are highly needed as one can say they broadly influence almost every aspect of the smart cities operation on daily bases [4]. 
In particular, trip route planning receives great interest particularly in big and crowded cities [4,5]. 
Principally, trip planning applications and service providers afford route recommendations based on relatively shorter paths, traffic congestion and even with up to date construction works [6].
Consequently, some of the route planning key players as Google have adopted online dynamic routing driven by live traffic network information. 
For example, Google maps provide an online suggestion for vehicle re-routing when roads are experiencing instantaneous traffic congestion based on many factors such as untraditional mobility behavior or accidents. 
On the other hand, corwdsensed based trip planning application Waze [7] relies on lively sensed traffic situations which shared with the users' intervention. 
APOLO [8] system was introduced to overcome the network overload introduced in many of the traffic management systems because of information exchange between vehicles and servers. 
This system proposed a centralized traffic monitoring system that works on both online and offline bases. 
In the offline stage, mobility patterns are conducted by historical data processing while in the online stage vehicles are re-routed away from the congested routes. 
The results showed travel time reduction of 17 % along with a speed increase of 6% compared to present approaches.\n
In addition, various efforts in the literature provided suggestions to enable shorter and faster routing for land vehicles. In [9], an adaptive routing approach was introduced and dealt with route planning as a probabilistic dynamic problem. 
In their algorithms, they aimed to reduce the predicted en route trip time while considering broadcasted traffic information, onboard based traffic state measurement, and historical traffic patterns.

text: Graph curvature, resembling curvature in continuous geometry, includes Gaussian curvature, Ricci curvature, and average curvature.
 Each of these elements serves a distinct purpose: Gaussian curvature measures local curvature at vertices, Ricci curvature assigns curvature to edges, and average curvature offers a global measure for the entire graph.
 Applications of graph curvatures span various domains in network alignment, congestion and vulnerability detection, community detection, and robustness analysis [32,54,55].\nThe recent work of curvature graph neural network (CurvGN) [93] introduced the notion of Ricci curvature into the field of graph learning.
 The study in [74] showed that edges with negative curvature can contribute to the over-squashing problem in graph embeddings.
 Coinciding with the announcement of the accepted papers for WWW 2023, we noted a parallel work by Fu et al.
 [22] that introduces the idea of class-aware Ricci curvature for addressing hierarchy-imbalance in node classification, while in our work, we aim to explore the integration of more generalized ricci curvature with hyperbolic graph convolution and curvature-based filtering mechanism to enhance the performance of HGCN for a more range of tasks, including node classification and link prediction.
