Task: Transform Sentence Structures for Referenced Papers and the Current Paper

Context:  
You are given a passage containing references to prior research papers (shown as [numbers]) and references to the current paper (e.g., “our paper,” “we,” or “this study”). Your goal is to restructure each relevant sentence to make these references the subjects where it makes logical sense, but without forcing unnatural constructions.

Entities to Modify  
1. Referenced Papers  
   - Any citation in the form [X] (e.g., [14], [7]) refers to a previous study.  
   - Where it fits naturally, transform the citation into the subject of the sentence by replacing “[X]” with {{bX}}.  
   - Do not rewrite the sentence in an awkward way just to make the citation a subject.

2. Current Paper  
   - Any phrase referring to the present paper (e.g., “our paper,” “we,” “this study”) is replaced with {{b0}}.  
   - Treat {{b0}} as a possible subject in the sentence if it flows logically.

---

Transformation Rules  

1. Natural Incorporation of Referenced Papers  
   - Preserve the original meaning while transforming sentences so that references become natural subjects wherever possible.  
   - Avoid forcing citations to the front of the sentence if it creates awkward phrasing. Use verbs like “stated that,” “proposed,” “introduced,” or “demonstrated that” to connect citations properly.

2. Current Paper as a Subject  
   - Replace the original references to the current paper with {{b0}}.  
   - If it naturally makes sense for {{b0}} to be the subject, reorganize the sentence accordingly.

3. Multiple References  
   - If a sentence cites more than one paper, combine them appropriately as joint subjects (e.g., “{{b3}} and {{b7}} stated that...”) or separate them if that’s clearer.

4. Logical Consistency  
   - Keep the sentence’s original intention and context intact. If restructuring creates confusion or awkwardness, leave the citation where it is.

5. Valid Citation Numbers Only  
   - Only use {{bX}} for citations that explicitly appear in the text.  
   - Do not introduce or modify citation numbers beyond what is given.

6. Preserve Sentence Count and Order  
   - If the original passage has N sentences, your output must also have N sentences in the same order.  
   - For each sentence in the input, either transform it (if needed) or leave it unchanged, but do not merge or split sentences.  
   - This ensures the output’s sentence count and sequence remain identical to the input.

Example 1:

Original:
<h1>abstract</h1> <p>Candidate retrieval is the first stage in recommendation systems, where a light-weight system is used to retrieve potentially relevant items for an input user
 These candidate items are then ranked and pruned in later stages of recommender systems using a more complex ranking model
 As the top of the recommendation funnel, it is important to retrieve a high-recall candidate set to feed into downstream ranking models
 A common approach is to leverage approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search from a single dense query embedding; however, this approach this can yield a low-diversity result set with many near duplicates
 As users often have multiple interests, candidate retrieval should ideally return a diverse set of candidates reflective of the user's multiple interests
 To this end, we introduce kNN-Embed, a general approach to improving diversity in dense ANN-based retrieval
 kNN-Embed represents each user as a smoothed mixture over learned item clusters that represent distinct "interests" of the user
 By querying each of a user's mixture component in proportion to their mixture weights, we retrieve a high-diversity set of candidates reflecting elements from each of a user's interests
 We experimentally compare kNN-Embed to standard ANN candidate retrieval, and show significant improvements in overall recall and improved diversity across three datasets
 Accompanying this work, we open source a large Twitter follow-graph dataset1, to spur further research in graph-mining and representation learning for recommender systems

 These methods either (1) match the query against clusters of items and rank clusters based on similarity to query or (2) utilize clusters as a form of item smoothing
