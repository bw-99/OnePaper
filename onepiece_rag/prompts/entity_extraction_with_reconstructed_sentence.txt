-Goal-  
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-

Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:

entity_type: One of the following types: [RESEARCH PAPER, CONCEPT, ORGANIZATION]

entity_name: The specific name of the entity.

When x is an integer, any instance of the form TOKEN_bx is considered a RESEARCH PAPER entity. This entity must be formatted exactly as [doc_id:bx], where doc_id is the provided document identifier and x is the number within the square brackets (e.g., TOKEN_b28 becomes [1:b28] for doc_id=1, and TOKEN_b15 becomes [3:b15] for doc_id=3).  
This naming rule for research papers is critical and must be followed without exception to ensure consistency and accuracy. Do not deviate from this rule under any circumstances.

If the entity_type is 'CONCEPT' or 'ORGANIZATION' use the name as it appears in the text.

entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities  
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other.  
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:

source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1

target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1

relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other

relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity  
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use 
{record_delimiter} as the list delimiter.

If you have to translate into English, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

Example 2:

text: TOKEN_b4 demonstrated that smart transportation and traffic management are highly needed as they broadly influence almost every aspect of smart city operations on a daily basis.
TOKEN_b4 and TOKEN_b5 highlighted that trip route planning receives significant interest, particularly in large and crowded cities.
TOKEN_b6 proposed that trip planning applications and service providers offer route recommendations based on relatively shorter paths, traffic congestion, and even up-to-date construction works.
Consequently, some of the key players in route planning, such as Google, have adopted online dynamic routing driven by live traffic network information.
For example, Google Maps provides online suggestions for vehicle re-routing when roads experience instantaneous traffic congestion based on various factors such as untraditional mobility behavior or accidents.
On the other hand, the crowdsensed-based trip planning application Waze, as demonstrated by TOKEN_b7, relies on lively sensed traffic situations that are shared with users’ intervention.
TOKEN_b8 introduced the APOLO system to overcome the network overload present in many traffic management systems due to information exchange between vehicles and servers.
This system proposed a centralized traffic monitoring approach that operates both online and offline.
In the offline stage, mobility patterns are derived through historical data processing, while in the online stage, vehicles are re-routed away from congested routes.
The results showed a 17% reduction in travel time along with a 6% speed increase compared to existing approaches.
Additionally, various efforts in the literature have suggested methods to enable shorter and faster routing for land vehicles.
TOKEN_b9 introduced an adaptive routing approach that treated route planning as a probabilistic dynamic problem.
Their algorithms aimed to reduce the predicted en route trip time while considering broadcasted traffic information, onboard-based traffic state measurements, and historical traffic patterns.

TOKEN_b34 proposed a paradigm shift in automatic documentation generation based on developers’ queries within their contexts.
TOKEN_b0 conducted a qualitative analysis of installation-related documentation update behaviors to gain a deeper understanding and provide motivation for developing automated software tools for documentation writing.
TOKEN_b35 highlighted that installation procedures vary in complexity, ranging from fetching a remote binary file to verifying system requirements, resolving dependencies, and ensuring component integrity.
TOKEN_b3 and TOKEN_b36 identified documentation problems and development environment configuration as significant barriers for newcomers contributing to Open Source Software (OSS) repositories.
TOKEN_b37 found that participation in OSS courses enhances student self-efficacy while also increasing their perception of documentation challenges, particularly regarding development environment setup.
TOKEN_b1 emphasized that the primary content category of README files is “How,” covering instructions from environment setup to installation and project execution, reinforcing their essential role in guiding newcomers and software users.
In contrast to previous studies focusing on the human perspective of OSS barriers for newcomers, TOKEN_b0 synthesized empirical evidence on software documentation activities related to installation by analyzing a large-scale dataset.
This empirical evidence will contribute to mitigating documentation-related barriers for newcomers engaging with OSS projects.
